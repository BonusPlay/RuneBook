> *The runes decide my path.* - Ryze, the Rune Mage

Greetings, Summoner!
This app is still in *heavy* development and I need your feedback! Anyone interested in the project can download the [latest release](https://github.com/OrangeNote/RuneBook/releases/latest) and try the app. It should work on Windows and macOS.

# The problem
The new Runes Reforged are great, but the overall experience isn't the best we could hope for. Yes, you can change runes while in champion select and that's great for customizing your playstyle, game by game, but you have a limited number of pages available. That means everytime you want to play a different champion you have to sacrifice one of your pages.  
\- *Well, it's ok, I can remake it afterwards.*  
But you aren't even able to remember the choices you made for your pages, and that's why you created a folder with screenshots ordered by champion that will help your memory: you will only have to copy the paths shown in figure when needed. Or you use online resources or guides if you don't even care about choices.

That sucks. That's an unnecessary waste of time (which is crucial in Champion Select by the way), and it's hard to manage your pages if you don't have a... Book.

RuneBook.
